This shell is a modification of the Endgame trackball [original shell](https://github.com/efogtech/endgame-trackball-3d-models/tree/d8d5728113b2dd74e77fdc04e657dafa912cdaab).

These files contain only the top of the trackball, since the bottom is compatible with the original.

The main differences are:

- All buttons use compliant springs, so the shell is slightly raised and slanted to make space for the button springs
- The internal ball cup is removed and the encoder openings are larger, to make it easier to insert and remove the shell without breaking the encoders
- No need for heat inserts, 4 M2 screws between 5 and 10mm can be screwed directly into the shell
- The shape of the buttons is slightly changed, so they follow the shape of the shell and the buttons on the bottom of the shell are a bit larger
- No magnetic buttons. Since the shell is angled, the buttons are a lot more accessible and I didn't feel the need for it. It would also complicate the design of the bridges

What is not working yet:

- I have to add more clearance for the 55mm ball, it only works if the BTU on the bottom is not fully inserted. I might do that if there is any interest.
- The middle buttons (top and bottom) are a bit harder to press than the side buttons, since the springs are shorter. It might be possible to improve that as well.

# Instructions

- Print with the buttons facing the build plate and only add supports on the build-plate. The encoder holes need support to print because the shell is angled, but this is the only supports that are needed!
- The recommended layer height is .2mm
- Works with PLA and PETG. I personally think that PETG is a better option, but a bit harder to print.
- Use 4 M2 screw to fasten the top to the bottom. Any size between 5 and 10mm should work fine.
